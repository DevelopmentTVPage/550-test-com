    "description": "Welcome to the summer fashion trend of wear-everywhere shorts \u2014 from high-styling cut-offs to unexpected textures \u2014 the high-waisted shorts are your crop top's best friend. \n\nThis summer, it's all about novelty cut-offs. From high waisted to crochet to distressed denim. The high waisted short is perfect for cropped tops and bandeaus. How cute is this look? This high rise white short is at the top of my shopping list this summer. The high rise silhouette keeps your crop top from being too scandalous. Pair it back with a neon bandeau and a light floral bomber for those cool summer nights.  \n\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/summer-shorts-skirts",
