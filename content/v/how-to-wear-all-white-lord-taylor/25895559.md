    "description": "Classic. Clean. Crisp. This summer's staple trend will be white on white.\n\nThis trend is called white out, and it's just simply white on white. It's simple and chic; it's like a palate cleanser. Put on a white dress or white outfit and you're ready for anything. You look totally fresh on a hot summer day. When going tonal white, have fun with texture, like a crochet skirt with a silky tank. Keep it modern and minimalist with accessories; a sporty watch and above all else a crisp pair of white Birkenstocks completes the white out trend.  \n\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/the-contemporary-shop",
