    "description": "Music festival fashion is definitely more chic than boho, and with a generous nod to the free-spirited past, today's aesthetic is effortlessly cool.\n\nWe're calling this trend Festival Fever. Inspired by summer concert goers, festival fever is all about that effortlessly cool look.  It's a little bit rock 'n roll, a little bit flower child. We're constantly inspired by perfectly thrown-together style. Think southwestern prints with a cut off short with a concert tee.  The look is really about mixing west coast ease with an east coast edge. Pile it on and really get creative; mix boho paisley with western fringe to get that perfectly unexpected combination. A pair of worn in boots, no matter what, are the unanimous punctuation point.\n\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/music-festival-style-guide",
