    "description": "With a nod to the free-spirited past, the the boho style updates its aesthetic and is the essence of cool - hello to the new boho outfit.\n\nThis summer, the boho look gets an update in desert prints. Katie is putting a spin on it by mixing solid black. The contrast really makes it stand out. Paisley prints, crochet, and the bed jacket are key to the look. And don't forget your fringe. Katie shows us how to give crochet a rock 'n roll spirit when paired with cool denim cut-offs and topped with our favorite bed jacket. I throw this piece over anything, almost like a cardigan. From a sundress to a t-shirt and jeans, it just makes you look instantly cool.  And don't forget to pile on a wrist-full of stacking bracelets and layer up those necklaces to get the new boho look. \n\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/boho-style-outfits",
